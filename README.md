## This Code is Heavily Inspired By The YouTuber: Cheesy AI
## Code Changed, Optimized And Commented By: NeuralNine (Florian Dedov)
## Code optimized by agoniko, now the power of the decision taken is influenced by the decision itself, in this way the other choices are shrunk towards zero and the neural network not only provides the decision to be taken (accelerate, brake, turn left/right) but by how much.

## This version also provides model checkpoints in order to save the progress of the neural network learning
